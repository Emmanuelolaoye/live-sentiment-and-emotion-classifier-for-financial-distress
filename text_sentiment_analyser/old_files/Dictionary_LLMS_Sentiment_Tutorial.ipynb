       " Document(metadata={'title': \"ETF Stands for 'Everything That Fits'\", 'link': 'https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/etf-stands-everything-fits-182106129.html', 'authors': ['George Kaloudis'], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'First Bitcoin, then Ethereum, now Solana. ETF issuers will stop at nothing so long as they believe they can make money.', 'publish_date': None}, page_content=\"One of the main crypto narratives this year has been the approval and trading of U.S. spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). They have been a resounding success. Not only have the bitcoin ETFs attracted $16 billion of inflows in half a year, the price of bitcoin (and therefore the prices of these ETFs) has increased by 46%.\\n\\nThe ETFs' success is so obvious that BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink came out and said he likes bitcoin now ( and not just because it can make his firm money! ). In a recent interview with CNBC, Fink said, “My opinion five years ago was wrong. I believe bitcoin is a legitimate financial instrument .”\\n\\nTo be sure, the assets under management (AUM) attributable to IBIT, BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, remains miniscule in the face of BlackRock’s total AUM (if you take out the AUM of IBIT – $18 billion – from BlackRock’s total AUM of $10.6 trillion, you’re still left with $10.6 trillion). Still, Fink's comment further legitimizes bitcoin in the eyes of the Boomer financial advisors now that firms like BlackRock and Fidelity (still waiting on Vanguard) bless bitcoin as a legitimate asset with a place in portfolios.\\n\\nSo Bitcoin, at least in this way, is here to stay.\\n\\nWhat about what’s next? Well, an ether spot ETF, of course, which may begin trading next week and is also expected to be a success (albeit on a smaller scale than the Bitcoin ETF).\\n\\nAnd then after that? Well, Solana ETFs naturally.\\n\\nOver a billion, 300 million, trillion, 300 million ETFs\\n\\nWhile I still personally maintain that bitcoin is different from other cryptocurrencies and is the only one which concretely does what it sets out to do, I think it is (and was) a significant mistake to assume bitcoin was in any way special in the eyes of high finance and Wall Street and, by extension, ETF issuers.\\n\\nThe U.S. ETF market is immense. Check the statistics from the Investment Company Institute for 2023: $8 trillion of assets; 218 firms providing ETFs; 3,108 total ETFs! And with good reason. ETFs make it trivial to compose your portfolio according to whatever investment thesis you may have.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor example, if you wanted to invest in healthcare or consumer discretionary goods there are sector ETFs for that. Say you’re young and want to chuck most of your portfolio into the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100. Just buy up a bunch of Invesco’s ETF QQQ, which tracks that. Whatever the idea, there’s an ETF for that.\\n\\nThey even have ETFs for more amusing, potentially farcical, ideas.\\n\\nSay you’re young and want to chuck most of your portfolio into the Nasdaq-100, but also you want to get rich three times as fast. You can buy TQQQ, which is the same as QQQ but it goes up (and down) three times as fast (this is achieved through debt, or leverage, hence the term “ triple levered ETFs ”).\\n\\nWhat if you want to buy an ETF even Jesus would like? Try WWJD . Do you see the virtue in vice and want to invest in worldly sins? Try VICE . What if you totally hate the investment advice of CNBC’s Jim Cramer? Try SJIM, the Inverse Cramer ETF, which follows the exact opposite of Cramer’s advice ( not for nothing, this ETF no longer exists, but it used to! ).\\n\\nWith this in mind, it’s plain that it wasn’t ever going to be “the Bitcoin ETF is the only ETF that will exist because bitcoin is better than the others and the SEC knows this.”\\n\\nTwo years ago I wrote :\\n\\n“If the SEC decided tomorrow that bitcoin was a security, it would change nothing about bitcoin fundamentally. It would also change nothing about bitcoin market manipulation being bad. It would just change who thinks they can regulate it at this particular moment.”\\n\\nPhilosophically, it didn’t matter if cryptos were securities then, and it doesn’t matter now. So now the Bitcoin spot ETF has come to the U.S. and next comes one for Ethereum and then the next one and the next and the next until we finally stop and ask ourselves: What exactly is stopping the potential issuance of a meme coin ETF ? Before you answer: “meme coins are securities,” remember that plenty of ETFs have securities in them (QQQ, TQQQ, WWJD, VICE).\\n\\nAs long as regulators are allowing new, shiny crypto ETFs, then the firms which provide ETFs will continue to provide them to the market because that’s what ETF providers do for a living. They make ETFs, investors buy them, and providers make a fee for managing them.\\n\\nEven though it seems now that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it will be stuffed à la turducken into an ETF, I do believe that cooler heads will (eventually) prevail, among investors and/or regulators. Even if it takes a Duckley ETF for that to happen.\\n\\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\"),\n",

Hannon explains that self-awareness is critical when planning for retirement, breaking it up into two lines of thought: the personal piece and the financial piece in this decision. \"It\\'s really being able to look at yourself and be honest and say, \\'What is my motivation for continuing to work? How is my health? What are my goals?\\'\" She notes that this aspect can be hard for many people who avoid thinking too far ahead, but it can be easier with help from a therapist, retirement coach, or friends and family. For those who have to continue working because they do not have enough savings to comfortably retire, Hannon encourages them to take a closer look at their overall finances. \"Give yourself some space to really look at all of your expenses. It doesn\\'t have to be down to the exact number, but what are some of the non-negotiable expenses you\\'re going to have moving forward? And what are the ones that are going to be more flexible? Once you get a bead on this sort of thing, you might figure out ways to get lean and mean,\" Hannon says.

    "## Dictionnary-based approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary-based approach is a simple way to perform sentiment analysis. It consists of using a list of words with associated sentiment scores. The sentiment score of a sentence is the sum of the sentiment scores of the words it contains. You can also normalize the score by the number of words in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this type of approach, we will need to use a financial sentiment dictionary. I will use the Loughran-McDonald dictionary, which is widely used in finance. Note that this dictionary is designed for financial statements, so it may not be the best choice for news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the dictionary from [here](https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/) (direct link: [Loughran-McDonald_MasterDictionary_1993-2023.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ptUgGVeeUGhCbaKL14Ri3Xi5xOKkPkUD/view?usp=sharing))\n",

    "### Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps to use a dictionnary based approach depend on the dictionnary you are using and the final measure you want to obtain. In this case, we will use the Loughran-McDonald dictionary, which contains variation of similar words, including plural forms, verb forms, etc. Therefore, we do not need to perform stemming or lemmatization, a common step in text preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps we will perform are:\n",
    "    - Lowercasing\n",
    "    - Removing punctuation\n",
    "    - Removing stopwords\n",
    "    - Removing numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The removal of stopwords and numbers is optional, but it will affect the sentiment score of the text as measure as a ratio of the number of words in the text. Other common filtering includes removing URLs, emails, cities, company names, etc.\n",

    "## Bert-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT-based models are often called \"state-of-the-art models\" in recent papers in the finance even if the original [Bert paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) dates from 2018 and many more advanced models have come along since. They are pre-trained on a large corpus of text and fine-tuned on a specific task. In this case, we will use FinBert, a BERT model fine-tuned on financial data (see [FinBert paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way these models work is by taking a sequence of tokens as input and outputting a vector of size 768 (or 1024, depending on the model). This vector can be used as input to a classifier to predict the sentiment of the text. The FinBert model is trained to output softmax outputs (ie, probabilities) for three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't perform any pre-processing on the text before feeding it to the model. The model will take care of tokenizing the text and converting it to a sequence of tokens. Common pre-processing for Bert models include masking some words (date, company names, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
